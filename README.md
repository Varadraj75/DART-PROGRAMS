# Dart Programs

This repository contains a collection of Dart programs ranging from basic syntax demonstrations to object-oriented concepts and logic-based problem solving. The goal is to provide simple, well-structured examples that help learners understand how Dart works, how to write clean code, and how to build a strong foundation before moving into Flutter or more advanced development.

## Overview

The programs in this repository cover fundamental Dart features, essential programming constructs, and practical examples that reinforce core concepts. Each script is self-contained, easy to read, and designed for learners who are exploring Dart either as their first language or as a stepping stone toward mobile application development.

## Contents

### 1. Dart Basics  
Programs demonstrating essential language fundamentals, including:
- Variables and data types  
- Operators and expressions  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops and iteration  
- Functions and parameters  
These files help establish a strong understanding of Dart’s syntax and flow control.

### 2. Collections and Data Handling  
Examples involving:
- Lists  
- Sets  
- Maps  
- Iteration techniques  
These programs show how Dart manages data efficiently and how collections can be used in practical scenarios.

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
Programs focusing on Dart’s OOP features:
- Classes and objects  
- Constructors  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Method overriding  
These examples provide a solid introduction to structured program design.

### 4. Practical & Logical Programs  
Logic-oriented examples that demonstrate:
- Input handling  
- Basic algorithms  
- Mathematical utilities  
- Pattern-based problems  
These scripts help sharpen reasoning skills and prepare learners for more complex use cases.

## Usage
